# Synthesthesia

Synthesthesia is a VR multimedia interactive experience designed to combine the best in spatial audio with music making. Synthesthesia is a part of the Triton XR Club at UCSD, a club dedicated to the proliferation and dissemination of AR, VR and MR content. Synth-esthesia is a free experience created in Unity for the HTC Vive. 

The purpose of this project is to explore how VR can be used to create multi-channel music. The hope is that we can create a tool that can be used not just spatialize music in VR but also create some or all of it.
