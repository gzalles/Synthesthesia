# Synthesthesia

Is an open music making platform that is designed to give the user a calming and engaging experience in which he/she will be making music and visuals.

There is no "end goal" to the experience other than for the user to express themselves through different systems we have created for them. These different modules offer enough variability and flexibility (hopefully) that the user feels continually engaged and interested in the process of manipulating parameters for sensory stimulation.

That's it. The backbone of the system will be Pd (one way or another) and the visuals and other graphics might be moved over to something cheaper like a smartphone system that is more widely accessible.
