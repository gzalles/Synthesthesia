# Synth-esthesia

Is an open music making platform that is designed to give the user a calming and engaging experience in which he/she will be making music and visuals.

There is no "end goal" to the experience other than for the user to express themselves through different systems we have created for them. These different modules offer enough variability and flexibility (hopefully) that the user feels continually engaged and interested in the process of manipulating parameters for sensory stimulation. They should also learn about music theory in the process and build compositions using LEGO blocks (modular units of music, from chords to individual notes).

At the present moment the system works on HTC Vive and was built inn Unity, however, we are exploring a FOSS approach in order to make this more accessible to the world.
